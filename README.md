# Mastering Nano
Mastering Nano is a book for developers, although the first two chapters cover Nano at a level that is also approachable to non-programmers. Anyone with a basic understanding of technology can read the first two chapters to get a great understanding of Nano.
This book does purposely follow the style of Mastering Bitcoin to make the comparison between the two projects and contribution to this project easier for everyone.

This repository contains the first edition(in progress).
